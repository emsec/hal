MILNERS SCHEDULER - AN EXAMPLE OF BDDs USED FOR STATE SPACE CALCULATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please read chapter seven in "An Introduction To Binary Decision
Diagrams" which is supplied in the "doc" directory. This chapter will
explain the example.

The program is called as "milner N" where N is the number of
cyclers. It will output the size of the reachable state space for the
system (compared to the true calculated size - for debugging purpose)
and a set of cache statistics.

Please also note that this file is used as an internal benchmark for
the author, so do not be too supprised if you find some strange debug
information in the code ...
