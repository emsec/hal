# Example Gate-Level Netlists
For demo purposes, we provide a few example HAL projects that are described below.

## FSM
Small FSM with 4 states, 5 external input signals, and 2 outputs. The netlist consists of 21 gates and 35 nets.

## Simple ALU

## Toy Cipher

## UART
UART core that receives 64 bit and then transmits the exact same 64 bit. The circuit operates at 100 MHz, the baud rate is set to 9600, and a stop bit is used. In total the netlist has 407 gates and 412 nets.
