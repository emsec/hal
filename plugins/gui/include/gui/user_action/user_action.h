     * @ingroup user_action
     * @brief The UserAction class is the abstract base class for user interactions
     *
     * It is expected that the exec() method gets called eventually. The derived classes
     * exec() method contains the implementation of the command. The exec function of the base
     * class needs to be called as well in order to store the interaction in the
     * user action managers history. At this point the user action manager is also
     * supposed to take the ownership of an user action object.
     *
     * While derived classes might contain additional arguments the member variable
     * mObject holds a standard argument like a single gate or module. Aditionally a parent
     * object can be given so that special types like pingroups can be associated and/or
     * identified with the corresponding module.
     *
     * If pointer to mUndoAction is set the interaction might be reversed using
     * Ctrl-Z in a future version of hal
     *
     * The mCompoundOrder number is the index of this action if part of an action
     * compound. It can be used to identify actions which belong together and might
     * be undone in a single step.
     *
     * The mWaitForReady flag causes the execution of a macro to be paused until
     * a handle (e.g. timer handle) resets the flag. It is considered to be a dirty hack and
     * should only be used in the case of extreme desperation.
