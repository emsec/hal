-- How to generate a vcd file for a new test netlist --

1. Synthesize netlist in your favorite tool, e.g., Vivado
2. Load netlist in HAL and use the hdl_writer_manager to output a fully-flattened netlist.
3. Put this netlist into your favorite simulator
4. Simulate, note the time you simulated, and export the VCD simulation

Hint: In Vivado, VCD dumps of simulations can be created via
    open_vcd
    log_vcd
    restart
    run all (or run X ns)
    close_vcd
The resulting vcd dump.vcd is located in the simulation files.
